            While I am in the primary school, I was able to help my friend to format PC. Thing work a little bit different that time. I install a fresh copy of Window (window XP if I not mistaken) to erase everything on the PC, and manually install each and every driver software (from graphic card, cd drive to audio) to get the computer to work. <br />
            I had interested in computer science but I didn’t choose to study it in university. My elder sister is a computer science graduate but didn’t manage to land a job in relevant field, she said all the stuff teach in colleague was outdated as the computer science development is too fast. While I was young, I hesitate on which course to take in my university, at the end I had chosen another path to study chemistry. I was a bit regret now, but I still grateful for everything. <br />
            After few years working, I feeling my life is stagnant. My job roles are more on monitoring and coordination. I want to develop a technical skill, therefore I step into the world of programming. <br />
            I nearly give up at the beginning during the CS50x program, the problem set is too difficult for me without adequate exposure in programming. But at the end I managed to change my mindset and complete this course.<br />
            I really enjoyed in create something through coding.<br />
            I love the world being create based on logic. As long as the logic is valid, I can build anything.<br />
            After I attempted to create my own projects, I realized it was difficult for me to stay focus as I have other commitments. There is no chance for me to involve in real life project to create something practical, also no opportunity for me to work with other programmer to learn how to collaborate with others to build a large scale project.<br />
            Therefore I am now look for the possibility to land a job as programmer so that I can have the opportunities to involve in real life project, create something that is practical and continue to develop my programming skills.

          I learn programming at the age of 30. I had proven myself as a lifelong learner, which capable to learn an Art which is completely different from my previous life. All the computer science concept, programming logic, language syntax etc. are very new to me. <br />
          I had a full-time job as quality engineer in manufacturing industries which required prolonged working hours. <br />
          On the other hand, I also spent significant of time to maintain a not-so-long-but-still-long-distance relationship with my lovely fiancé,  who lived in the other side of the city. <br /> 
          I managed to learn programming from zero despite all the commitments, I believe if given a chance for me to focus in this industry, I will become an expert within short period.

          I believe is the mindset and attitude. <br />
          mindset – have an architect blueprint in mind which know the overall structure and direction. Once a blueprint is established, work on the implementation details by break down bigger problem into smaller piece and tackle it one by one. <br />
          Attitude – stay humble, positive and proactive to look for a solution to resolve an issue and to achieve a goal. <br />
          Technical skills can learn but mindset and attitude can’t, I believe both mindset and attitude are important characteristics that lead to the programmer to move forward.
